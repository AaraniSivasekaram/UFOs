# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this challenge was to create a webpage that pulled in UFO sighting data and be able to filter this data by date, city, state, country and shape of the UFO sighting. The end result in an interactive webpage that allows interested individuals to check out a UFO article and search UFO sightings of interest.![Full Webpage](https://github.com/AaraniSivasekaram/UFOs/blob/main/Full%20Webpage.png)

## Results
To use the webpage, here is a step-by-step process:
1. Refresh all data by selecting the UFO Sightings button on the top left corner of the webpage.![UFO Sightings Refresh Button](https://github.com/AaraniSivasekaram/UFOs/blob/main/UFO%20Sightings%20Refresh%20Button.png)
2. Enter filter searches based on the defined categories: date, city, state, country and shape of the UFO sighting. Webpage users can enter one or multiple filters.![Input Filters](https://github.com/AaraniSivasekaram/UFOs/blob/main/Input%20Filters.png)
3. Once the information is entered into one/multiple filters, the UFO sighting data is now filtered based on input. You may continue to add filters to further refine search results.![Example Search Result](https://github.com/AaraniSivasekaram/UFOs/blob/main/Example%20Search%20Result.png)
4. Refresh all data by selecting the UFO Sightings button on the top left corner of the webpage and begin a new search!

## Summary
- One drawback of this webpage design is that once filters are entered, you cannot remove any filters and have the data refresh automatically. 
- A recommendation for further development would be to have a larger dataset, it would be interesting to see these filters applied on a much larger global dataset.
- Another recommendation would be to automatically refresh the data once a filter was removed.
